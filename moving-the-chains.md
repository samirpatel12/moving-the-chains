What do blockchains and sports have in common? A lot more than one might expect. This post is a think-piece written ~collaboratively with~ mostly by [Samir Patel](https://twitter.com/samirpatellaw) while we were kicking it marmot style at Michigan State University this weekend. #lawyerswhocode

## Sports business practices

Although professional sport leagues and their affiliated teams are being considered businesses under the American laws that govern commerce, there have been particular laws and precedents putting professional sport in a different legal consideration than ordinary business. Investigating these precedents helps to understand how owners have recently strengthened their grip on the monetary flow of sport.

In today's sport industry there is a push by stakeholders to maintain an equitable split in revenues to ensure ownership groups do not exploit them.  This has been of particular importance over the decades during collective bargaining agreements. When discussing collective bargaining agreements, the concepts of revenue sharing, player compensation/salary caps, and taxes are seperate, yet, inextricably linked. Revenue sharing and salary cap restrictions are two examples of particular concern for collective bargaining agreements. 

Revenue sharing is when the league creates revenue streams and requires its teams to contribute to a pool based upon different standards established by each league. Generally speaking, shared revenues primarily include local and national television rights. These shared revenues are intended to help lower income franchises and create competitive balance throughout the league.

This would seem to be great for the Cleveland Brown's fan who hopes to one day have a winning season, however, revenue sharing serves as a pressure point on the salary of players. In professional sports, a salary cap is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on a player. The higher the salary cap, the more a player can be paid (read: total for all players on a team). Any withholding of revenue by the owners can diminish a player's salary. In fact, in Feb 2016, an arbitrator ordered the NFL to [pay back $120 million to the NFLPA](http://fortune.com/2016/02/23/nfl-salary-cap/) for what the league called an "accounting error." This averages out to $71000 for each player. This is a significant amount to the undrafted rookie playing on a one year contract.
 
Player compensation and revenue sharing considerations aside, owners also have an interest in creative accounting practices in order to receive public subsidies from local governments. There has been an [incredible stadium boom in professional sports](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/sports/25stadium.html?_r=0) within the past two decades. Owners have used the "need" for new stadiums or renovations as a point of emotoinal leverage with the public in order to receive public funding. This has become important for the big four sports leagues because a major source of unshared revenue comes from luxury box, club seating, and personal seat licenses.

In Santa Clara, the city broke ground on a [$1.3 billion staidum for the San Francisco 49ers](http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/how-the-49ers-got-a-stadium-and-why-it-wont-work-here/). The deal included $116 million in public funding, with private capital making up the rest. However, the team disguised a $950 million loan as coming from institutions led by Goldman Sachs when actually the loan was coming from the Santa Clara Stadium Authority. Which, you guessed it, is a government entity. Taxpayers were tricked by the team in thinking that their investment into the new stadium was minimal when actually it was essential. Furthermore, if the team is unable to pay the loan, taxpayers would be out $950 million which could have gone to infrastructure or education. 

The use of creative accounting practices by owners, to fatten their wallets and often times taking advantage of players and taxpayers. Owners hide revenues and certain expenses to paint a picture of poor financial team health, in order to maximize player salary efficiency and public subsidization. The following diagram elaborates:

The problems identified above can be summarized as follows: mutliple parties - each with different interests and motivations - need to agree on a common truth. Creative accounting practices skew profits in favout of team owners. In the case of revenue sharing there is lack of transparency with respect to total revenues, burdening smaller teams and players salaries. In the latter example, cities overpay in subsidies. 

How does a blockchain add value here? When most (if not all) aspects of teams' portfolio is tracked on a chain, the innacuracies are easily spotted. For revenue sharing, the players and smaller teams benefit by getting the correct cut. For stadium financing, the taxpayers aren't duped into paying for a stadium that the team owner can easily afford. 

In football, "moving the chains" is synonymous with first downs and progress. Each time the team moves the chains, it gives itself a new suite of options, oppportunities, and knowledge. The playbook opens up. Similarly, a blockchain opens up the playbook of sports business.

## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger where transactions are validated and updated through consensus of the participants in that specific blockchain. For teams and players that are directly affected by the financial disclosings of other teams, blockchains offer a harmonized solution for ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, they offer near instant settlement of dues for the revenue sharing program (cash flow) and timely/accurate information on the coming salary cap.

As the diagram below shows, all stakeholders of the revenue streams in the NFL could serve as a validator on the blockchain.  Each team will input their revenues on the blockchain shared by the other teams. Total team revenues can be updated after each game or immediately as a revenue is brought in. This allows for teams to project the amount the would need to contribute to revenue sharing quicker and more accurately. Additionally, more accurate projections for team salary caps the following year will be available, since these also now updated in real-time.

Players will benefit from the implementation of a blockchain because they can be assured that there are no creative accounting tricks lowering their rightful share of the total revenue pie. Player unions can have peace of mind knowing that the financial documents outlining the total league revenues is accurate. Teams are unable to modify revenues because as each revenue is incurred, it is recorded on the blockchain. This data allows the player unions to better negotiate player compensation during collective bargaining negotiations.

The technology also helps the league maintain parity which is the ultimate goal of revenue sharing. First, it ensures that the richer teams are contributing their fair share into the revenue sharing fund. Smart contracts can automatically deduct each teams established contribution to the revenue sharing pie and can significantly reduce accounting errors. Small market owners can know that the richer teams are not hiding revenues from them. 

Further, it also allows the league to open up free agency sooner; teams can formalize their restor quickly. Currently, the league gives itself a month to investigate team financial documents and establish the salary cap. Smart contracts can distribute the funds dedicated to player salaries shortly after the last play of the Superbowl, with teams signing players soon with less hesitation. In this way, team rosters are formalized quickly in the offseason, allowing them more time to strategize and gameplan for the upcoming season. 

Of course, this all for nothing if teams don't have a stadium to play in. As alluded to earlier, owners have leveraged the affection of football from fans for taxpayer dollars without much oversight of their financial integrity or health. The Minnesota Vikings received $506 million from public funds for the [construction of their new $1.1 billion stadium](http://www.startribune.com/vikings-tap-many-sources-for-stadium-funds/311897781/) while the 49ers used [creative accounting to extract $950 million from Santa Clara taxpayers](http://www.fieldofschemes.com/news/archives/2012/03/4859_santa_clara_49e_6.html).

If financial documents were placed on a blockchain then the citizens of Minnesota and Santa Clara would not have footed most of the bill for a private football stadium. Cities should demand that any owner seeking funds for a new stadium participate in a blockchain that identifies all revenue streams. If teams are truly seeking public co-operation than they should have no problem doing this because they truly need public funds for a new stadium. Owners who are looking for public funds knowing full well that they do not need them would hesitate to be a part of the blockchain. After five years, the city would have a better understanding of the financial health of the team subsequently allowing it to make an educated and credible subsidy for a new stadium.

## What about the owners?

Now you're probably asking yourself that there are no way NFL owners are going to agree to have their financial records on a blockchain for all to see, but not everyone will have access to the records. Owners can pick and choose which stakeholder will have access to the records and when. Player unions can have access to records leading up to CBA negotiations but not during. Taxpayers can have access to records for five years leading up the vote on whether they should help fund a new stadium. By showing greater transparency, players and taxpayers will have more of an incentive to negotiate for the betterment of the ecosystem as a whole rather than their own personal gain.

Professional sports teams - like any other large business - benefit from quality data in real-time or near real-time; data used to support their analytical and systems decisions. The ticket deparment can base ticket prices using data from previous games (and of others teams) more easily. The concession department can order more of a certain type of beer that is selling well. In addition, a blockchain can decrease the operating costs for teams by trimming accounting overhead.

Old business practices have caused the National Football League to suffer massive public relation hits with both players and common sports fans. Owners are seen as a old boy's club made of billionaires who have schemed their way to wealth. By using blockchain and smart contract technology, owners can maintain their place in one of the more lucrative sports leagues while embracing transparency. Not only can they change the way they are viewed, owners can also change the way the business of sports is conducted. That's moving the chains.
