What do blockchains and sports have in common? A lot more than one might expect. This post is a think-piece written collaboratively with [Samir Patel](https://twitter.com/samirpatellaw) while we were kicking it marmot style at Michigan State University this weekend. #lawyerswhocode

Despite professional sport leagues and affiliated teams being considered businesses under the American laws that govern commerce, there have been particular laws and precedents putting professional sport in a different legal consideration than ordinary business. Investigating these precedents helps to understand how owners have recently strengthened their grip on the monetary flow of sport.


In today's sport industry there is a push by stakeholders to maintain an equitable split in revenues to ensure ownership groups do not exploit them.  This has been of particular importance over the decades during collective bargaining agreements. When discussing collective bargaining agreements, the ideas of revenue sharing, player compensation/salary caps, and taxes are seperate ideas but are, in fact, inextricably linked. Revenue sharing and salary cap restrictions are the two points for particular concern under the notion of a collective bargaining agreement. 

Revenue sharing concerns itself with the league creating revenue streams and requiring its teams to shre those streams based upon different standards established by each league individually. Generally speaing, shared revenues primarily include local and national television rights. The shared revenues are intended to help the lower income and small market franchises create a competitive balance through the league.

This would seem to be great for the Cleveland Brown's fan who hopes to one day have a winning season, however, revenue sharing serves as a pressure point to players and the amount they can should be paid. In professional sports, a salary cap is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on a player. So the higher the salary cap, the more players can be paid. Any withholding of revenue by the owners can diminish a player's salary.  In fact, in Feb 2016, an arbitrator ordered the NFL to pay back $120 million to the NFLPA for what the league called an "accounting error." This averages out to $71000 to each player.[1](http://fortune.com/2016/02/23/nfl-salary-cap/) This is a significant amount to the rookie in one year contract.
 
Aside from the player compensation and revenue sharing conversations, owners also have an interest in creative accounting practices in the interest of receiving public subsidaries and air from local governments. There has been an incredible stadium boom in professional sports within the past two decades. [2](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/sports/25stadium.html?_r=0)Owners have used the "need" for new stadiums or renovations as a point of emotoinal leverage with the public in order to receive public funding. This has become important for the big four leagues because one majot source of unshared revenues comes from luxury box, club seating, and personal seat licenses.

In Santa Clara, the city borke ground on a $1.3 billion staidum primarily for use by the San Francisco 49ers. The deal includes $116 million in public funding, with private capital making up the rest. However, the team guised a $950 million dollar loan as coming from institutions led by Goldman Sachs when actually the loan was coming from the Santa Clara Stadium Authority. Which, you guessed it, is a government entity. Taxpayers were tricked by the team in thinking that their investment into the new stadium was minimal when actually it was quintessential. Furthermore, if the team is unable to pay the loan, taxpayers would be out $950 million which could have gone to infrastructure or education.

The use of creative accounting practices by owners, which fatten their wallets while often times taking advantage of players and taxpayerse. Owners hide revenues and certain expenses to paint a picture of poor financial team health to the three parties in order to maximize player salary efficiency and public subsidization.   

The problem identified above can be summarized as follows: mutliple parties - each with different interests and motivations - need to agree on a common truth. In the case of revenue sharing there is lack of transparency with respect to local TV revenues whereas the creative accounting practices in the second case puts a burden on the taxpayer.

How does a blockchain add value here? When most (if not all) aspects of teams' portfolio is tracked on a chain, the innacuracies are easily spotted. For revenue sharing, the players benefit by getting the correct cut. For stadium financing, the city isn't duped into paying for a stadium the owner can easily afford. 

Where do the smart contracts come in?

Additional examples:

- endorsements (social media)
- crowdsourcing where a player plays
