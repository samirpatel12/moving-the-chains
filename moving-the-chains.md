Despite professional sport leagues and affiliated teams being considered businesses under the American laws that govern commerce, there have been particular laws and precedents putting professional sport in a different legal consideration than ordinary business.

In today's sport industry there is a push by players to maintain an equitable split in revenues to ensure ownership groups do not exploit them.  This has been of particular importance over the past five years during collective bargaining agreements. Players associations are not the only groups who are affected by the finanancial management of professional sport owners.
