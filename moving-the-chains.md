What do blockchains and sports have in common? A lot more than one might expect. This post is a think-piece written collaboratively with [Samir Patel](https://twitter.com/samirpatellaw) while we were kicking it marmot style at Michigan State University this weekend. #lawyerswhocode

Although professional sport leagues and affiliated teams being considered businesses under the American laws that govern commerce, there have been particular laws and precedents putting professional sport in a different legal consideration than ordinary business. Investigating these precedents helps to understand how owners have recently strengthened their grip on the monetary flow of sport.

In today's sport industry there is a push by stakeholders to maintain an equitable split in revenues to ensure ownership groups do not exploit them.  This has been of particular importance over the decades during collective bargaining agreements. When discussing collective bargaining agreements, the concepts of revenue sharing, player compensation/salary caps, and taxes are seperate, yet, inextricably linked. Revenue sharing and salary cap restrictions are two examples of particular concern for collective bargaining agreements. 

Revenue sharing is when the league creates revenue streams and requires its teams to contribute to a pool based upon different standards established by each league. Generally speaing, shared revenues primarily include local and national television rights. These shared revenues are intended to help the lower income and small market franchises and create a competitive balance through the league.

This would seem to be great for the Cleveland Brown's fan who hopes to one day have a winning season, however, revenue sharing serves as a pressure point on players and, the amount they can and should be paid. In professional sports, a salary cap is an agreement or rule that places a limit on the amount of money that a team can spend on a player. The higher the salary cap, the more a player can be paid (read: total for all players on a team). Any withholding of revenue by the owners can diminish a player's salary. In fact, in Feb 2016, an arbitrator ordered the NFL to [pay back $120 million to the NFLPA](http://fortune.com/2016/02/23/nfl-salary-cap/) for what the league called an "accounting error." This averages out to $71000 to each player. This is a significant amount to a rookie in a one year contract.
 
Player compensation and revenue sharing considerations aside, owners also have an interest in creative accounting practices in order to receive public subsidies from local governments. There has been an [incredible stadium boom in professional sports](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/sports/25stadium.html?_r=0) within the past two decades. Owners have used the "need" for new stadiums or renovations as a point of emotoinal leverage with the public in order to receive public funding. This has become important for the big four leagues because a major source of unshared revenue comes from luxury box, club seating, and personal seat licenses.

In Santa Clara, the city broke ground on a [$1.3 billion staidum for the San Francisco 49ers](http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/how-the-49ers-got-a-stadium-and-why-it-wont-work-here/). The deal included $116 million in public funding, with private capital making up the rest. However, the team disguised a $950 million dollar loan as coming from institutions led by Goldman Sachs when actually the loan was coming from the Santa Clara Stadium Authority. Which, you guessed it, is a government entity. Taxpayers were tricked by the team in thinking that their investment into the new stadium was minimal when actually it was essential. Furthermore, if the team is unable to pay the loan, taxpayers would be out $950 million which could have gone to infrastructure or education. 

The use of creative accounting practices by owners, which fattens their wallets while often times taking advantage of players and taxpayers. Owners hide revenues and certain expenses to paint a picture of poor financial team health to the three parties in order to maximize player salary efficiency and public subsidization.   

The problem identified above can be summarized as follows: mutliple parties - each with different interests and motivations - need to agree on a common truth. In the case of revenue sharing there is lack of transparency with respect to local TV revenues whereas the creative accounting practices in the second case puts a burden on the taxpayer.

How does a blockchain add value here? When most (if not all) aspects of teams' portfolio is tracked on a chain, the innacuracies are easily spotted. For revenue sharing, the players benefit by getting the correct cut. For stadium financing, the city isn't duped into paying for a stadium the owner can easily afford. 

In football, "moving the chains" is synonyms with first downs and progress. Each  the team moves the chains, it gives itself a new array of options, oppportunities, and knowledge. The playbook opens up. There is a playbook out there authored by some of the world's most foward thinkers titled Blockchain and it provides the ability to move the chains of sports business.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger where transactions are validated and updated through consensus of the participants in that specific blockchain. For teams and players that are directly affected by the financial disclosings of other teams, blockchains offer a harmonized solution for ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, they offer near instant settlement of dues for the revenue sharing program (cash flow) and timely/accurate information on the coming salary cap.

As the diagram below shows, any stakeholder of the revenue streams of the NFL can serve as a validator on the blockchain.  Each team will input their revenues on the blockchain shared by the other teams. Total team revenues can be updated after each game or immediately as a revenue is brought in. This allows for teams to project the amount the would need to contribute to revenue sharing quicker and more accurately.  Futhermore, the NFL will be able to provide a more accurate projection for team salary caps the following year, seeing as how they ae based off the previous years total. 

Playes will benefit from the implementation of a blockchain because know they can be assured that there are no creative accounting tricks being deployed to lower rightful share of the total revenue pie. Player unions can have peace of mind knowing that the financial documents outlining the league revenues is accurate because of its inherent transparent nature. Teams are unable to modify revenues because as each revenue is incurred, it is recorded on the blockchain. This data allows the player unions to better negotiate player compensation during collective bargaining negotiations.

The technology also helps the league maintain parity which is the ultimate goal of revenue sharing.  First, it ensures that the richer teams are contributing their fair share into the revenue sharing fund. Smart contracts can automatically deduct each teams established contribution to the revenue sharing pie.  The smart contracts prevent creative accounting. Small market owners can know that the richer teams are not hiding revenues from them. It also allows the league to open up free agency sooner, which allows to teams to formalize their roster sooner before the start of the season.  The league gives itself a month to investigate team financial documents and establish the salary cap.  Smart contracts can distribute the funds dedicated to player salaries shortly after the last play of the Superbowl. Teams can sign players soon after that.  This allows teams to formalize their roster soon in the offseason, allowing them more time to strategize and gameplan for the upcoming season. 

Of course, this all for not if teams don't have a stadium to play in. As elluded to earlier, owners have leveraged the affection of football from fans for taxpayer dollars without the need to prove their financial integrity or health. The Minnesota Vikings received $506 million from public funds for the construction of their new $1.1 billion stadium. [5](http://www.startribune.com/vikings-tap-many-sources-for-stadium-funds/311897781/) The 49ers used creative accounting to extract $950 million from Santa Clara taxpayers.[4](http://www.fieldofschemes.com/news/archives/2012/03/4859_santa_clara_49e_6.html)

If financial documents were placed on a blockchain then the citizens of Minnesota and Santa Clara would not being footing most of the bill for a private football stadium owned by a billionaire or two. Cities should demand that any owner seeking funds for a new stadium should participate in a blockchain that identifies all revenue streams. If teams are truly seeking public co-operation than they should have no problem doing this because they truly need public funds for a new stadium. Owners who are looking for public funds knowing full well that they do not need them would hesitate to be a part of the blockchain. After five years, the city would have a better understanding of the financial health of the team subsequently allowing it to make an educated and credible subsidy for a new stadium.

Now you're probably asking yourself that there are no way NFL owners are going to agree to have their financial records on a blockchain for all to see, but not everyone will have access to the records. Owners can pick and choose which stakeholder will have access to the records and when. Player unions can have access to records leading up to CBA negotiations but not during. Taxpayers can have access to records for five years leading up the vote on whether they should help fund a new stadium. By showing greater transparency, players and taxpayers will have more of an incentive to negotiate for the betterment of the ecosystem as a whole rather than their own personal gain.

The blockchain will also give team owners more data about their financial state which will allow them to make better business decisions.
